        <p>Crossword Maze is a game that was created at a summer DreamCode2012 event and prepared for Liberation Pixel Cup competition. It was created during 4-5 days with use of Crafty javascript game engine. The idea of the game is to practice typing while having fun. Go on with the instruction, and try to get a highest score!</p>

<p>During the game you will need to complete 3 different stages. On every stage you need to get as many points as possible (by collecting golden an quest letters). To finish the stage you will need to go to the portal/hole in the ground/grab a bag of gold. Between the stages you will see a screen with a current game status.</p>

<p>Here are some details.</p>

<p>A main hero. Hero can move up, down, left, right in a maze. To move in a desired cell you need to type a letter that is located in that cell. If you mistype - your final score will be decreased.</p>

<p>To complete a playing stage you will need to move a hero to the portal/hole/bag of gold. To do that position your hero next to the portal and press SPACE/ENTER.</p>

Each of them increases your score. If you collect all of them - you will get some extra score. Press SPACE/ENTER to proceed.</p>
