        <p>Crossword Maze game prototype was created at a summer DreamCode2012 event. It was created during 3 days with use of Crafty javascript game engine. The idea of the game is to practice your typing skills and get some entertainment. Prototype lacks music, graphics, tutorial and some usefull features, but it has all gameplay and game mechanics in it. Go on with the instruction, and try to get a highest score!</p>

<p>During a game you will need to complete 3 different stages. On every stage you need to get as many points as possible (by collecting golden an quest letters). To finish the stage you will need to go to the portal. Between the stages you will see a screen with a current game status.</p>

<p>Here is a playing field.</p>

<p>A yellow rectangle is a main hero. It can move up, down, left, right in a maze. To move in a desired cell you need to type a letter that is located in that cell.</p>

<p>To complete a playing stage you will need to move a hero to the portal (a blue rectangle). To do that position hero next to the portal and press SPACE.</p>

<p>This is a starting screen. It shows you the current game stage (0 out of 3). There is also a task/quest in a game. To complete it you need to collect letters you see on a info screen. Each of them increases your score. If you collect all of them - you get some extra score. Press SPACE to proceed.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.forknights.com/games/CrosswordMaze/docs/tutorial/FinalScreen.jpg" alt="FinalScreen"></p>

<p>This is a screen with the final game score. To restart the game press SPACE.</p>

<p>How to improve your score:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect golden letters (yellow letters)</li>
<li>Avoid danger letters (red letters)</li>
<li>Avoid typing mistakes (when you press a key so hero is not moving)</li>
<li>Try to complete the quest</li>
</ul>
