DreamCode 2012

A maze like typing game. The playing field is a maze/crossword. Player can move main character by typing (typed key selects the direction). For every maze you get a task - to find a set of letters. End level by going to exit. If you succeed then you unlock those letters in a hall of the Alphabete. The task is to unlock whole alphabete in a shortest time.

Would be intresting to have
* a fog of war
* some enemies
* bonuses/upgrades (marked exit, light letters, slowing down time, mistake protection, fast letters unlocks)
* additional unlocks
