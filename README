DreamCode 2012

A maze like typing game. The playing field is a maze/crossword. Player can move main character by typing (typed key selects the direction). For every maze you get a task - to find a set of letters. End level by going to exit. If you succeed then you unlock those letters in a hall of the Alphabete. The task is to unlock whole alphabete in a shortest time.

Would be intresting to have
* a fog of war
* some enemies
* bonuses/upgrades (marked exit, light letters, slowing down time, mistake protection, fast letters unlocks)
* additional unlocks
* dynamically changing level (cells not next to player might change values from time to time)

Day1
Select an engine
Draw a hero
Navigate a hero
Draw a random level
Treat black cells as solid

Day2
+Clean up code
+Start and finish positions
+Level complete, congratulation message
+Restart rounds, store statistics
+Calculate mistakes (in callback)
+Restart game (delete finalScene in a endRound)
+Inter-round screens (with current status)?
+Fix graphical issue
+Welcome screen with the task
+Mistakes vs golden
+Collect golden letters (in callback)
+Add randomly placed bombs
+Keep track of collected letters
+Add special letters to collect (give a task to a user)

Day3
+Reward for collected letters
+Final screen with statistics
+Intermediate screen with golden letters


Ideas:
-Play until all letters are found (limit golden, limit danger, allow to exchange)
	-Exchange rate - 5 other golden letters for the one you need
-Add solid cells
-Add bombs with time (so it is harder to collect all gold)

-Center the text

-Fix resources for level, hero
-Add movement animation with Tween
-Crafty pause/stop

CODE optimizations:
+Search for a Game object from a callback
+Split code to different files
+Canvas vs DOM
Use position instead of coordinates
Use functions as parameters
Set names for Crafty entities
